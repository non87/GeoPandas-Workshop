    "\n",
    "Welcome. This is the first part of the Introduction to GeoPandas Workshop. Strangely enough, today we will not talk about [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/ \"GeoPandas\") (gpd) at all. Today, we will be exploring [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/ \"Pandas\"). As the name suggests, GeoPandas crucially depends on Pandas. Pandas is a Python package offering a  convenient way to handle data.  Therefore, a working knowledge of this package is necessary to use GeoPandas. More in general, Pandas is one of the basis of most data analysis pipelines in Python. Therefore, it is useful to know how it works!\n",

This is the intution behind the **DataFrame** object. A DataFrame is the way Pandas represents tabular data. Every row represents an entity. Every column represents a characteristic.

    "This is a typical case where selection helps (there are other workarounds, but selection is the way we will do it). Lucky enough, we know how to select from our work with Series. So, selection in DataFrame will be way quicker. As for Series, a selection can be based on position, label or values. We will use our friends .iloc[ ] and .loc[ ] for selections on positions and labels, respectively. The key difference between Series and DataFrame when selecting is that in a DataFrame you have to select *2* dimensions. You have a selection for the row and a seletion for the column. When you select on both rows and columns by label/position, you must use the same kind of selection (label or position) for both dimensions. Selection by value is more flexible. It is done with .loc[ ] and it typically mixes a value selection for row and a label-selection for columns (see examples below)."

    "\n",
    "Let's start with creating our own index for the data. You may have notice a column named \"Unnamed: 0\". This was the original index column in the data. We can signal this to Pandas when loading the data -- but we did not know before opening the data! Anyway, we will create an index from the information in each row using the [.iterrows()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.iterrows.html?highlight=iterrows#pandas.DataFrame.iterrows, \".iterrows( ) Documentation\") method. It is substantially similar to the .iteritems() method from Series, in that it outputs a tuple where the first element is the index of the row and the second element is the content of the row...in the form of a Series!\n",
    "\n",
    "To change index we will use the method [.set_index( )](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.set_index.html#pandas.DataFrame.set_index, '.set_index( ) Documentation'). This is probably a good time to mention that Pandas has a specific kind of object to represent an Index for a Series or a DataFrame. This kind of object is called [Index](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Index.html?highlight=index#pandas.Index, \"Index documentation\"). It is substantially an unmutable numpy ndarray. This is really nothing to be concerned about too much, but we need to be aware of this when setting a new index for the DataFrame -- see the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create a index in the form \"publisher_integer\", where integer is a running count of how many heroes any publisher produced. There are many ways to do this. In the space of a single loop we can use a [Counter](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/collections.html#collections.Counter, \"Counter Documentation\") dictionary from collections. Also, Counters are great, so it is good to know they exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will drop the not-so-interesting \"Unnamed: 0\" column with the method [.drop( )](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.drop.html?highlight=drop#pandas.DataFrame.drop, \".drop( ) Documentation\"), which, as the name suggests, is used to drop columns or rows."
